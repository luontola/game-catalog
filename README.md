# Rapid Application Template (WIP)

Spreadsheet/MS Access/Airtable replacement. Something which is quick to get started like a spreadsheet, but enables an
incremental transition to a custom application when the solution grows to require a general purpose language.

    npm rum pom

Start dev server

    npm run start
